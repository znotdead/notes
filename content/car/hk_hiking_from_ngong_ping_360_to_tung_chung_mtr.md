### HK: Hiking from Ngong Ping 360 to Tung Chung MTR

**Route:** Tei Tong Tsai Country Trail
**Length:** Near **9**km
**Getting to NP360:**
 - By bus 23 from Tung Chung MTR (Fastest way as no many people in line, and cheapest 17.2HKD and 27HKD on Sundays and PH)
 - By Ngong Ping 360 (More attractive and must visit if you have never been there, expensive 115HKD or 180HKD in crystal cabin (Recommend to ride once!) in one turn)

**Group:** As usual me, father and daughter(1y9m).
**Our Time:** 5 hours (with getting up to Tian Tan Buddha and making photos)
**Date:** 24 Jan 2015

**Condition:**
All time concrete road with a small part (no more than 500m) of stairs down at the end of road. So it is easier to move from NP360 to Tung Chung with small baby and stroller. But on part with stairs it is easier if your baby can walk down himself.

**Notes:**
Wonderful in winter. No spiders and butterflies and other insects. Only at evening some mosquitoes. At all will be fine in summer as the most of road surrounded by trees. Not windy route.
