**Condition:**
7 section Not accessible with stroller. Section 7 may be half shaded but Needle peak is exposed. Sometimes no cell coverage but on peaks signal is strong. Recommend to visit highest point of Grassy hill. There will be small observation place. Not recommend in rain or hot weather. As there will be a lot of puddles and mud. Can be slippery. So trek pole can be useful. A lot of stairs when uphill. Easier to go in reverse.

**Notes:**
A lot of barbeque zones. No places to refill with water or food.
