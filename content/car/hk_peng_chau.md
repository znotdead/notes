**Getting to:**

**Attractions:**
- Beaches
- Sea views

**Group:** As usual me, father and daughter(1y9m).
**Our Time:** 9 hours
**Date:** 28 Jun 2014

**Condition:** Not very comfortable with stroller because of stairs and you need return back sometimes or go by stairs.

**Notes:**
Not very interesting place. Just few wild beaches and good sea views. On Family Walk there are many spiders so we turned on intersection of roads to Peng Chau Finger Hill to Nam Shan Rd (not shown on Google Maps) and went back.
