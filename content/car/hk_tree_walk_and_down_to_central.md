### HK: Tree Walk and down to Central

**Route:** Walk around The Peak (Tree Walk) and down by Old Peak Road and through MidLevel to Sheung Wan
**Length:** 7 km
**Getting to:**
- The Peak Tram (Return 40HKD, Single 28HKD) but very long waiting time especially on weekends and PH.
- Bus from Pier 5 or Exchange Square, Central (bus no. 15) (9.8HKD) but travelling time min 40min.

**Attractions:**
- HK
- The Peak views
- Peak Tower
- Tree Walk

**Group:** Me and daughter(1y).
**Our Time:** 3.5 hours
**Date:** 19 May 2014

**Condition:** Tree walk easy accessible with stroller. Old Peak Road also accessible but slope too large. MidLevel awful with stroller because  of stairs(down in this route, so not so bad) but anyway you will need to walk by roads with transport and roads narrow. Sheung Wan district normal to walk with stroller.

**Notes:** Excellent views on Tree Walk. Interesting and almost empty Old Peak Road and too many people (as usual) in Central. There is no place to get food or water on Old Peak Road till you reach MidLevel.
