### JS: curvy corners

There is an alert when using `curvycorners.js` and open in Namaroka for example.

For me I went to `about:config` and change user agent to `firefox ( general.useragent.extra.firefox)` or as it is written on forums simply remove this alert, i.e `'else curvyCorners.alert('Scanstyles does nothing in Webkit/Firefox');'` but than you should download src of the library and compile it youself. Why they leave this alert ???
