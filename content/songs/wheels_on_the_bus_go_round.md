Summary: The wheels on the bus go round (lyrics)

### The wheels on the bus go round and round

The wheels on the bus go round and round.
round and round.
round and round.
The wheels on the bus go round and round,
all through the town!

The door on the bus goes open and shut.
Open and shut.
Open and shut.
The door on the bus goes open and shut,
all through the town!

The people on the bus go up and down.
up and down.
up and down.
The people on the bus go up and down,
all through the town!

The horn on the bus goes beep, beep, beep.
beep, beep beep.
beep, beep, beep.
The horn on the bus goes beep, beep, beep.
all through the town!

The wipers on the bus go swish, swish, swish.
swish, swish, swish.
swish, swish, swish.
The wipers on the bus go swish, swish, swish,
all through the town!

The signals on the bus go blink, blink, blink.
blink, blink, blink.
blink, blink, blink.
The signals on the bus go blink, blink, blink,
all through the town!

The motor on the bus goes zoom, zoom, zoom.
zoom, zoom, zoom.
zoom, zoom, zoom.
The motor on the bus goes zoom, zoom, zoom,
all through the town!

The babies on the bus go waa, waa, waa.
waa, waa, waa.
waa, waa, waa.
The babies on the bus go waa, waa, waa,
all through the town!

The parents on the bus go shh, shh, shh.
shh, shh, shh.
shh, shh, shh.
The parents on the bus go shh, shh, shh,
all through the town!

The mummy on the bus says, I love you.
I love you, I love you
The daddy on the bus says, I love you, too.
All through the town.
